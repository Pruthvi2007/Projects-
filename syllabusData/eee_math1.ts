Assessment Details (both CIE and SEE):
The weightage of Continuous Internal Evaluation (CIE) is 50% and for Semester End Exam (SEE) is 50%. The minimum passing mark for the CIE is 40% of the maximum marks (20 marks out of 50). The minimum passing mark for the SEE is 35% of the maximum marks (18 marks out of 50).

Continuous Internal Evaluation (CIE):
The CIE marks for the theory component of the IC shall be 30 marks and for the laboratory component 20 Marks.
CIE for the theory component of the IC:
- Three Tests each of 20 Marks; after the completion of the syllabus of 35-40%, 65-70%, and 90-100% respectively.
- Two Assignments/two quizzes/ seminars/one field survey and report presentation/one-course project totalling 20 marks.
Total Marks scored (test + assignments) out of 80 shall be scaled down to 30 marks.

CIE for the practical component of the IC:
- On completion of every experiment/program in the laboratory, the students shall be evaluated and marks shall be awarded on the same day. The 15 marks are for conducting the experiment and preparation of the laboratory record, the other 05 marks shall be for the test conducted at the end of the semester.
